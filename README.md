|Saber|Saber clone was taken from Glitch and modified so blue shows in the left eye, red shows in the right eye. [Link](https://twoxfh.github.io/aframe/saber/)|
|LetterRay|The idea came from bkkl, its letterray experience no longer worked on my Quest, this was an attemp to re-create a similar experience.

|Tweaked Physics|This was taken from Aframe Animation Examples by Stemkoski and modified for objects to appear in different eyes. [LINK] (https://twoxfh.github.io/aframe/physx/quest-physics.html)
